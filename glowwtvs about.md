i've got blood on my hands splattered all across the walls!

i've got years of lacking empathy! i don't need it at all!

fuck your reason! fuck your meaning! fuck your stupid fragile feelings!

all you ever feel is pain so i would rather just feel nothing! [×](https://open.spotify.com/track/42NO1CgBdqn9jm0bZ2zpQp)

***

i wanna be a 3d ghost in your dreams

the smell of burning flesh and sweat and chlorine

i feel like heavy eyes and drugs and smokescreens

i feel like telling lies and love and morphine [×](https://open.spotify.com/track/56lS40vp0sFpgFwvVle1I8)

***

i wanna get fucking worse, i wanna get fucking worse, oh

don't wanna get fucking worse, don't wanna get fucking worse, no

i wanna get fucking worse, i wanna get fucking worse, oh

won't let myself get worse, don't wanna let myself get worse— [×](https://open.spotify.com/track/3kUnMYg05ughCG68fgMDH1)
