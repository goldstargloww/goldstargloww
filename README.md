**hello, it's the golb :D**

# about me
*"i am dying too much to be alive" -gold, 2021*

## links for my info
i have some other places where i store things about me to keep things organized!
- [general info](https://goldstargloww.carrd.co) *infrequently updated, small innacuracies, generalized*
- [identities](https://rentry.co/goldstargloww) *lots of em, infrequently updated, small innacuracies*
- [pronouns](https://en.pronouns.page/@goldstargloww) *pronouns kept up to date, identities not so much*

## info

- i'm a minor (13-15)
- pronouns (auxillary): she/they
- pronouns (preferred): they/glow/void/aster/aer/she
- i go by gold, but golb is fine too in a /nsrs way
- i use tone tags
- i have adhd, autism, and *lots* of anxiety hadfgkjs
- i keyboard spam to show emotion sometimes (usually laughing, but can also be when i'm embarrasedish or going crazy lol)
- i'm part of a willogenic system, but i prefer to be referred to as singular most of the time as its mostly just me
- i'm an inclusionist when it comes to identities especially :> brain stuff is so weird that it's stupid to gatekeep it, you're safe to talk to me about anything :>
- you are completely fine to swear around me and i'd heavily prefer no slurs :> i do swear sometimes but its rare enough that it might be weird to see/hear, *please* don't point it out! it makes me uncomfortable :<
- please don't sexualize me (i'm a minor so thats a given, but even other minors please don't)! romanticizing me is okay as long as stuff like kissing isnt involved in any way, also things like saying "i love you" directly makes me uncomfortable (cuddling and handholding is ok tho :>)
- i code in python (sitll learning) and skript<sup>([?](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript#readme))</sup>, and i'm planning on learning java
